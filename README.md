ANTLITZ.NINJA was developed for the [Coding da Vinci Hackathon Rhein-Main 2018](https://codingdavinci.de/de/events/rhein-main-2018). ANTLITZ.NINJA is a web-based application to create new pieces of art from existing paintings and drawings. ANTLITZ.NINJA is compatible with the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF). 

ANTLITZ.NINJA was twice [awarded](https://codingdavinci.de/de/projekte/antlitzninja) – in the categories most technical and most innovative:
