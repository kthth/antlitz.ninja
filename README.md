ANTLITZ.NINJA was developed for the [Coding da Vinci Hackathon Rhein-Main 2018](https://codingdavinci.de/events/rheinmain/). ANTLITZ.NINJA is a web-based application to create new pieces of art from existing paintings and drawings. ANTLITZ.NINJA is compatible with the International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF). 

ANTLITZ.NINJA was twice awarded – in the categories most technical and most innovative:

BEWARE! ANTLITZ.NINJA is a hack, it is not intended to demonstrate exemplary programming, it was built to work.
